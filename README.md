## 🎯 Project Overview

This project simulates a **Customer Escalation Reduction Program** for a support operations environment.  
The goal was to **improve service quality** by addressing:

- High escalation volumes  
- SLA breaches and inconsistent First Response Times  
- Workflow inefficiencies in triage and ticket routing  
- Lack of analytical visibility  

To solve these, I executed a multi-sprint Agile plan covering data foundations, analysis, and process improvements.

## 🚀 Sprint Breakdown

### **Sprint 1 — Data Foundations**
- Identified escalation data sources  
- Cleaned raw escalation & response-time datasets  
- Built the first version of the Power BI dashboard  
- Created visual insights on issue types & daily escalation trends  

**Key Deliverables:**  
- Clean datasets  
- Trend charts  
- Baseline escalation analysis  

---

### **Sprint 2 — SLA Response Time & Bottleneck Analysis**
- Analyzed First Response Times (FRT) for SLA compliance  
- Identified daily, weekly, and capacity-driven bottlenecks  
- Highlighted workload patterns and triage inefficiencies  
- Created SLA breach analytical charts  

**Key Outcomes:**  
- Root cause identification  
- Visibility into SLA performance  
- Evidence-backed improvement opportunities  

---

### **Sprint 3 — Process Improvement & Final Reporting**
- Designed improved triage workflow  
- Strengthened feedback loop for recurring issues
